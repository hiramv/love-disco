                    We matched on <strong>Hinge</strong> in August 2019â€”an ice breaker about hip hop kicked things off, and our first date was at neighborhood bar Baby Jane on August 23rd. (Fun fact: Chelsea was sober that night, and we both happened to know the manager, making for an even more memorable first meeting.)

                <p class="story-paragraph">
                    By our second date, we bonded over Miami Spice dinners and a shared <strong>love of food</strong>â€”though Chelsea quickly learned that if you tell Hiram he can have the last bite of dessert, he'll take it. It wasn't until the third date, an hours-long Sunday afternoon that effortlessly stretched from movie matinee to dinner, that we realized something really special was unfolding.

                    A few months later came our first trip, first <strong>"I love you,"</strong> and meeting each other's families. Then came 2020 like a wrecking ball with an unexpected testâ€”moving in together during lockdown and navigating the uncertainties of the pandemicâ€”which only strengthened our bond and deepened our connection.

                <p class="story-paragraph">
                    <strong>Six years</strong> later, we've had some amazing adventures around the world (including a three-month stint in LA), and the best part is, it still carries the same spark that started it all.

                <p class="story-paragraph">
                    We chose Ibiza for our wedding because it embodies everything we love: food, music, travel, and <strong>vibesss</strong>. As a Puerto Rican and a Miamian, we've always felt most at home by a beach â€” and ever since our first trip to this magical island in 2022, we knew it was where our hearts belonged.

                    In November 2023, we were on vacation in <strong>Bordeaux, France</strong>, and while I had my suspicions (with it being such a romantic place), I finally started to unwind a couple days into the trip. After a morning at the hotel spa, we wandered over to <strong>ChÃ¢teau Smith Haut Lafitte</strong> for an impromptu wine tasting and stroll through the vineyard's art-filled grounds.
                </p>

                <p class="proposal-paragraph">
                    It had been a cloudy day, but the sun came out and was making everything look glorious in the <strong>golden hour</strong> light, so as usual, I was taking lots of pictures while walking around. Apparently Hiram had been searching for that "perfect moment" to do it, and decided to go for it right as I was <strong>taking selfies</strong> of us.
                </p>

                <p class="proposal-paragraph">
                    As you can see in the third photo, my finger tapped that shutter button before my brain could even process what was happening. Both of us had been on pins and needles with anticipation the days prior, but right then, I was completely caught off guard. I dropped my phone into my coat pocket and turned around for his very <strong>heartfelt speech</strong> (which he later says he blacked out for haha).
                </p>

                <p class="proposal-paragraph">
                    With no one around but the hundred-year-old vines, it felt like the world paused just for us. We both cried happy tears.
